Facebook-Messages-Redirect
==========================

A small Chrome extension that redirects facebook.com to facebook.com/messages when you type it in the address bar, so that you don't unconsciously keep ending up on Facebook, scrolling through your news feed like a zombie.

Install it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-messages-redirec/afngganpacgobfdfojegpfmomflliche)
